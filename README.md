Make sure you have Python 3.12 installed. It might run with lower versions, but 3.12 is what the script was written on. <br>
Once you are in the directory, you can run the command `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the requirements. <br>
To run the program: <br>
`python ctrlFind.py --keyword Whatever You Want To Search For` <br>
you might have to run <br>
`python3 ctrlFind.py --keyword Whatever You Want To Search For` <br> if that's how your system is set up.

Currently the search is based on pattern matching at the beginning of a word. Hopefully will be extended to more soon!
